# Jisho-Anki-Bridge

Extension to streamline the process of moving jisho.org search results to Anki deck cards, since at the time of writing this there does not seem to be any better tools to do this efficently. (Also this works as a nice exercise to learn about chrome extensions since I haven't implemented these before)

Requirements: You need to be signed in ankiweb.net and probably have the latest chrome installed.
